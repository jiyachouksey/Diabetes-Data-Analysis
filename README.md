🩺 Diabetes Prediction | EDA + Logistic Regression Model
📌 Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on diagnostic measurements.

🎯 Objective
Clean the dataset and handle invalid zero values

Explore and visualise data distributions and relationships

Build and evaluate a Logistic Regression classification model

💻 Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Dataset Details
Dataset: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Add dataset link if used from Kaggle or local)

Rows: 768

Columns: 9

Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

Target: Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
