# 🩺 Diabetes Data Analysis

This project analyses the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** to identify patterns and factors influencing diabetes. It includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), a basic logistic regression model, and an interactive Power BI dashboard** for visualising key insights.

---

## 🔍 **Problem Statement**

Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Early detection and understanding risk factors can help in better management and prevention. The goal of this project is to analyse medical data to identify the features most strongly linked to diabetes.

## 📂 **Dataset**

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Records:** 768 patients  
- **Features:** Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome

---

## 🛠️ **Tools Used**

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard and KPIs

---

## ✅ **Project Steps**

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Replaced invalid zero values with median for realistic medical data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis  
   - Correlation heatmap to identify key features

3. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression for basic prediction (achieved ~78% accuracy)

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing KPIs, distributions, and relationships

---

## 🌟 **Key Insights**

- **35%** of patients in the dataset are diabetic
- **Higher glucose (>130 mg/dL)** and **BMI (>30)** significantly increase diabetes risk
- Logistic Regression model indicates these features as top predictors

## 🔮 **Future Improvements**

- Try other ML models (Random Forest, SVM) for higher accuracy
- Deploy model as an API for real-time prediction
- Integrate with larger, more diverse healthcare datasets
